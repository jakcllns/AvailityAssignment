# AvailityAssignment
###### These are my code samples for the coding exercises in the Fullstack Homework Assignment.

Question 4 folder contains a single javascript file

Question 5 folder is a Create React App package. Some assets to help style it similar to Availity's existing website were borrowed.
  
 * Assets borrowed are:
    - images
      - loginTop.png
      - login_bkgd.jpg
      - sprite_new.png
    - css code
      - elegant_login.css
      
Question 6 folder contains Python files and some mockData.
  ##### Python version used is 3.6.6 and will require os and csv libraries which usualy come with standard python install
  * The CsvParser.py contains the main function
  * The CompanyModel.py is just a file I used for storing the class I built for handling some of the operations
