###### These are my code samples for the coding exercises in the Fullstack Homework Assignment.

Question 4 folder contains a single javascript file

Question 5 folder is a Create React App package. Some assets to help style it similar to Availity's existing website were borrowed.

      - login_bkgd.jpg
      - sprite_new.png

Question 6 folder contains Python files and some mockData.
